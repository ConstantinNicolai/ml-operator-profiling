Offline performance and energy consumption prediction model of deep learning training tasks by  Jianchen Han, Yingwen Chen 
I want access to this paper !!

ATTENTION: random forest can only learn values in the range of the training samples
dynamic valotage and frequency scaling can screw things up. at least if we cant hit it over the head with a law of large numbers approach club
